# Binary-Classification-Model
 
## Goal
The purpose of this study is to provide summary, descriptive analysis and cleaning steps of the training data of this assignment.

The exercise_40_train.csv file is going to be training dataset for the models of this study.

## Data Description
The dataset we analyze contains 40000 observations. Along with the target variable, we have 101 columns in exercise_40_train.csv,and 100 columns in exercise_40_test.csv

## Code and Results
End of the each section and in the middle of the code blocks you will encounter the main/intermadiate findings of the study as brief comments.

The "1.EDA & Data Cleaning" file shows the code and results for Explaratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning steps of the exercise_40_train.csv.

The "2.Modeling" file shows the code and results of preprocessing and machine learning models.

The "glmresults.csv" file contains the prediction results obtained from Logistic Regression.

The "nonglmresults.csv" file contains the prediction results obtained from Neural Network.
